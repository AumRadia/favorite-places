# Favorite Places App

This Flutter app allows users to save and manage their favorite places. Users can enter a title, take a photo using the camera, and select a location either manually or using the device’s GPS. All the data is stored locally on the device using SQLite, so it remains even after the app is closed. Users can view details of saved places on a map and delete them if needed.
